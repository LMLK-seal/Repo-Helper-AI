# Project Roadmap and Future Ideas

This project has a strong foundation, but there are many potential enhancements for the future.

## Short-Term Goals
-   **Duplicate Issue Detection:** Before answering, the bot could search the vector database for similar *past issues* and link to them, saying, "This looks similar to issue #123."
-   **Learning from Maintainer Edits:** If a human maintainer provides a better answer, the system could ingest that new question-answer pair to improve its future responses.

## Long-Term Goals
-   **Automated Code Analysis:** By feeding code snippets from bug reports to a more advanced AI model, the bot could suggest potential fixes or identify the exact line of code causing the problem.
-   **Pull Request Summaries:** The bot could be triggered on new Pull Requests to provide an AI-generated summary of the changes for easier review.
